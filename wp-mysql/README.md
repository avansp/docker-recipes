# Composing WordPress & MySQL Services


This docker was copied from Docker's tutorial: https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/.

Basically, this creates two separate docker images:

1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) service for WordPress webpage
2. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database service


```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
